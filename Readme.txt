Hello! This project (Spaceship) was developed by Maxime Dahan in 2018 with Paul Karmel's assistance.
This is a Java project developed in an attempt to learn more about the graphics implementations in Java.
The program was written in the first year of our software programming career, and we were ignorant toward the importance of writing clean code.

This project was developed in two days.

Most of the code and game design was created and written from scratch by Maxime Dahan.
Most of the sounds and graphics were created from scratch by Paul Karmel.
Please launch "Spaceship.jar" in order to play the game.
