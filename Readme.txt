Hello! This project (Spaceship) was developed by Paul Karmel in 2018.
This is a Java project developed in an attempt to learn more about the graphics implementations in Java.
The program was written in the first year of my software programming career, and I was ignorant toward the importance of writing clean code.

This project was developed in two days.

All of the sounds, graphics and animations were created from scratch by Paul Karmel.
Please launch "SpaceMain" in order to play the game.

Press "R" in-game to reset your high-score.
Press "C" in-game to close the program.
Arrow keys are used to move. Hold the spacebar to shoot.

Bullets are buggy.
